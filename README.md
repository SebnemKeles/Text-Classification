# Text-Classification
Implemented topic classification models to categorize documents into five topics (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech) using different text preprocessing and feature extraction techniques. Evaluated model performance on a test set with confusion matrices and classification metrics.


# üìù Topic Modelling and Classification


## üß† Project Summary

This project performs topic classification of news articles into 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. It leverages classical text processing and machine learning methods to build topic labellers that classify documents based on their content. The work is based on a simplified version of the BBC News dataset from Kaggle.


## üîß Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Numpy / pandas / NLTK / Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
  

## üöÄ Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Tokenize, Lemmatize, Normalize
   - Histogram equalisation, Edge dedection

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF vectorization 
   - BoW vectorization 
     
3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression
  
4. **Hyperparameter tuning**
   - GridSearchCV

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall
   - Confusion Matrix 


## üß™ Results

| Model                            | Accuracy 
|----------------------------------|----------
| Logistic Regression with TF-IDF  | 0.97%    
| Logistic Regression with BoW     | 0.95%
